I'm God. I'm worm. I'm everyone. I'm no one.

Small and big, close and far, in and out - there's everything and
there's nothing.

You, who dares to touch it.
You, who sees no reason to be afraid.
You, who thinks (s)he knows.

Be afraid, be cautious, hesitate.

No one steps far as the next step is the hardest one.
No one is afraid as the scary things are the closest ones.
No one hesitates as control frees of fears.

False illusions, false control, false promises. Are you willing to continue?
