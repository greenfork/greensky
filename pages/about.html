I'm God. I'm worm. I'm everyone. I'm no one.

Small and big, close and far, in and out - there's everything and
there's nothing.

You, who dares to touch it.  
You, who sees no reason to be afraid.  
You, who thinks (s)he knows.  

Be afraid, be cautious, hesitate.

No one steps far as the next step is the hardest one.  
No one hesitates as control frees of fears.  
No one breaks free without knowing they are in captivity.  

False illusions, false control, false promises.  
Are you willing to continue?
