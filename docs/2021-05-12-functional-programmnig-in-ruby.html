  <h1>Functional programming in Ruby</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle-date">12th of May, 2021</h2>
  <p>Ruby is a classic Object-Oriented programming language. But it also has some
functional features built into the language such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and
<code>reduce</code>. Here we will explore more functional concepts and how they can be
used in Ruby.</p>
<h2>Function</h2>
<p>First, a quick refresher on what a function is.</p>
<p>This is a function in mathematical notation:</p>
<pre><code>f(x, y) = x + y
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function in Ruby:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">def add(a, b)
  a + b
end
</code></pre>
<p>A function only depends on its arguments, never on external state.</p>
<p>These are not functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">def time_now
  Time.now
end

b = 3
def add3(a)
  a + b
end
</code></pre>
<p>but these are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">def time_at(timestamp)
  Time.at(timestamp)
end

def add3(a)
  a + 3
end
</code></pre>
<h2>Functions bad!</h2>
<p><code>ActiveRecord</code> is a Ruby ORM used in Rails. How do we find the user with ID 5?
There's a method <code>find</code> in <code>ActiveRecord</code>, we can imagine that it is implemented
as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def find(id)
    # Connection is global and set up somewhere else
    $db_conn.find_by_id(id)
  end
end

User.find(5)
</code></pre>
<p>Is this functional? No. This is functional:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def find(db_conn, id)
    db_conn.find_by_id(id)
  end
end

User.find(db_conn, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>which is suboptimal at best. This is why we don't always want to use
functional style in Ruby. But can we do better? Let's try that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class User
  def find(id, db_conn: $db_conn)
    db_conn.find_by_id(id)
  end
end

User.find(5)
</code></pre>
<p>If we don't specify anything but ID, it works same as with global db connection.
But what it also allows is to test this method with mocks, we
will use <code>Minitest</code> testing library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'minitest/mock'

user_id = 5
user = User.new(id: user_id, name: &quot;Peter&quot;)
test_db_conn = Minitest::Mock.new
test_db_conn.expect(:find_by_id, user, [user_id])

assert_equal User.find(user_id, db_conn: test_db_conn), user
</code></pre>
<h2>Templates as functions</h2>
<p>Rails by default uses templating engine called ERB which can use instance
variables defined in controller. Let's assume that controller has 2 variables
defined <code>@id = 5</code> and <code>@name = &quot;Peter&quot;</code>, then we can write a template like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div&gt;
  Hello from &lt;%= @name %&gt;
  with ID &lt;%= @id %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Rails also has a notion of a &quot;partial&quot; which means that a template can be
included inside another template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">// main.html.erb
&lt;div&gt;
  Hello from &lt;%= @name %&gt;
  &lt;%= render partial: 'id_partial' %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

// _id_partial.html.erb
with ID &lt;%= @id %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>They both use same instance variables as in the example above. How do we make
it functional?</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">// main.html.erb
&lt;div&gt;
  Hello from &lt;%= @name %&gt;
  &lt;%= render partial: 'id_partial', locals: { user_id: @id } %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

// _id_partial.html.erb
with ID &lt;%= user_id %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>_id_partial.html.erb</code> does not directly reference the instance variable
<code>@id</code> and is a function because this partial doesn't rely on external state.</p>
<h2>The problem of state</h2>
<p>State - is something that accumulates during program execution. In Ruby it
is typically contained in instance variables. Let's write a simple stack
implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Stack
  attr_reader :stack

  def initialize(array = [])
    @stack = array
  end

  def push(n)
    @stack.push(n)
  end

  def pop
    @stack.pop
  end

  def peek
    @stack.last
  end
end

st = Stack.new
st.push(1)
st.push(2)
st.peek       #=&gt; 2
st            #=&gt; [1, 2]
st.pop        #=&gt; 2
st.stack      #=&gt; [1]
</code></pre>
<p>In this simple implementation we can easily see all the program paths.
In order to know what <code>st.pop</code> returns, we need to keep track of <code>@stack</code>
instance variable.
But with more and more state it becomes increasingly harder. Imagine if
we need to know not 1 but 3 or 5 instance variables in order to know
what will be the return value of a method?</p>
<p>A functional implementation of a stack would be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class FuncStack
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def init(array = [])
      array
    end

    def push(stack, n)
      stack.push(n)
    end

    def pop(stack)
      stack.pop
    end

    def peek(stack)
      stack.last
    end
  end
end

st = FuncStack.init
FuncStack.push(st, 1)
FuncStack.push(st, 2)
FuncStack.peek(st)     #=&gt; 2
st                     #=&gt; [1, 2]
FuncStack.pop(st)      #=&gt; 2
st                     #=&gt; [1]
</code></pre>
<p>We don't rely on any external state and explicitly say which stack we want
to operate on. And we clearly see all the variables that are going to affect
what <code>pop</code> or any other method returns.</p>
<h2>Functional style perks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easier to tell what functions do and what they return</li>
<li>Easier to test</li>
<li>More explicit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Going deeper with finite-state machines</h2>
<p>Functional style can be used to model complex interactions between states.
Instead of modifying the state in-place in response to different events,
we can describe it as transitions between separate stages.
Finite-state machine - is a convenient model for describing these transitions.</p>
<p>Let's try to model a user application for our services with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>User provides an email</li>
<li>User confirms the email</li>
<li>User chooses appropriate application</li>
<li>User confirms this application</li>
<li>User provides additional info</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that the User will not necessarily follow these steps
sequentially as we described, for example the user can refuse to confirm their
email until the step 4 or even never confirm it.</p>
<p>Let's try to model this interaction with the condition that the User can only
confirm their application after they have confirmed their email:</p>
<img class="pure-img" src="assets/images/user_application_fsm.png">
<p>This is the most simple FSM graph. And we can already see clearly all the states
and draw additional lines in order to know what happens when user presses
&quot;Cancel&quot; or a network error occurs.</p>
<p>Let's try to implement a part of it in Object-Oriented style:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">class UserApplicationFSM
  attr_reader :state, :data

  def initialize(state = :user, data = {})
    @state = state
    @data = data
  end

  def provide_email(email)
    case @state
    when :user
      @state = :confirmed_user
      @data[:email] = email
    else
      raise 'Incompatible state'
    end
  end

  def choose_application(application_id)
    case @state
    when :unconfirmed_user
      @state = :unconfirmed_user_choose_dialog
      @data[:application_id] = application_id
    when :confirmed_user
      @state = :confirmed_user_choose_dialog
      @data[:application_id] = application_id
    else
      raise 'Incompatible state'
    end
  end

  # ...
end

fsm = UserApplicationFSM.new
fsm.state                          #=&gt; :user
fsm.provide_email('email@pm.com')
fsm.state                          #=&gt; :unconfirmed_user
fsm.choose_application(1)          #=&gt; :unconfirmed_choose_dialog
</code></pre>
<p>This works quite well, we have an internal state which keeps track of
what transitions are available and which data we get back. So what's
wrong with it?</p>
<p>What if we don't have our <code>fsm</code> object all the time? For example, we operate
on this state across several http requests in a web-server. How do we
restore the state in the middle of a state machine? We could do it like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">fsm = UserApplicationFSM.new
fsm.provide_email(params[:email])
session[:state] = fsm.state
session[:email] = fsm.data[:email]

# Send response
# Receive application_id

state = session[:state]
application_id = params[:application_id]
fsm = UserApplicationFSM.new(state, { email: session[:email] })
fsm.choose_application(application_id)
session[:state] = fsm.state
session[:email] = fsm.data[:email]
session[:application_id] = fsm.data[:application_id]
</code></pre>
<p>This gets hard to manage pretty quickly, we have to use session to store
intermediate data in order to restore the state of <code>UserApplicationFSM</code>.
A much easier approach is to always supply all the needed state in every
request. And we can also cheat along the way, as for example, we definitely
know that we don't need to keep <code>email</code> in the state all the time, it is
already saved into the database. We can as well use this kind of interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">state, data = UserApplicationFSM.init
data[:email] = params[:email]
state, data = UserApplicationFSM.provide_email(state, data)

# Send response
# Receive :unconfirmed_user state and application_id

state = params[:state]
application_id = [:application_id]
data = { application_id: application_id }
state, data = UserApplicationFSM.choose_application(state, data)
</code></pre>
<p>This is much clearer because we always send <code>state</code> and <code>data</code> and we always
receive back <code>state</code> and <code>data</code>. The implementation of this FSM is left as an
exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>These are some general and broad ideas of how to use functional programming
in Ruby. Not every concept should be designed in functional paradigm, but it
is a tool that allows you to express ideas more clearly where traditional
OOP style proves to be too cumbersome to operate on. Use with caution but
explore with curiosity!</p>
